# CP1404 Practicals #

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About the Repo ##

This repo contains my practical work for CP1404 at JCU. Practicals 1 - 10 (folders: `prac_01` - `prac_10`)
is available with programs and text documents that contain data.
> They are completed every week with help from the
[CP1404 Programming Patterns page](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns) and with instructions
> provided by the [CP1404 Practical instructions repo](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals).

Practicals 6 - 10 are code reviewed by helpful programmers. **Feel free to take a look for inspiration or coding help
in this repository**.

## About Zac Gormly (Me) ##

As of 2025, I am a first year at JCU studying Bachelor of IT. My favourite subject has been machine
learning so far as I've found it to be the most interesting and a field I'm interested in pursuing
as a career.

## What Best Practices Have I Learnt From CP1404? ##

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) for functions
- Good naming: `variable_name`, `CONSTANT_NAME`, `ClassName`, `do_something` (function name), `key_to_value`, `things`
  (list name)
- Using familiar patterns that always work (while loop, for loop, exception handling patterns)
- Remembering program file consistencies including module docstrings, function docstrings, leaving one line at the
  end of the file, and having all program sections in the correct order (e.g. module docstring -> import statements
  --> CONSTANTS, etc.)
- Refer to proper documentation such as PEP8 Python standards.
- Considering the overall readability of the program and how it flows.
- Considering how code could be maintained later by another user.
- Always remembering to commit your code.
