# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

At either my house, or my grandparents' house, I usually watch CP1404 lecture videos on Friday night and anytime on Saturday. Sunday and Monday is dedicated to other subjects' videos. For CP1404, the past two weeks' videos have taken up most of my Saturday (due to the length of the videos and that I write notes).

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I will keep watching every lecture video, going to every seminar and doing every practical right after the seminar. I have also made sure to take breaks as neeeded.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to be more active in the seminars and engage more with the lecturer in terms of saying answers.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I need to improve my flow of committing work and writing commit messages. I also need to remember to add function docstrings, as I usually only remember once I finish a program.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I believe the way I write my programs is of best practice and I am making sure to focus on every detail in the instructions.
