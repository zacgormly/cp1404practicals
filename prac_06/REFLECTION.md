# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have tried being more active in the seminars and I feel that my commit messages are more appropriate. Furthermore,
I have been using docstrings better and remembering to put them in during the program for readability.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to approach my work better in terms of writing code, testing then refactoring based on readability or
efficiency issues/requirements. In terms of application, I need to apply my dictionaries and sets better and possibly
learn more general practices that people use for classes/objects. In terms of 'time on task', I need to be a bit quicker
and do not dwell on certain parts of the problem too long. Furthermore, my attitude towards the work is pretty good. I
only ever find the lecture videos a bit long, but I think I need to plan out my breaks better.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

My flow of watching lecture videos, doing practicals and assignments is going well. My way of learning by writing notes
while watching the videos seems to be working well as I am retaining information. My coding abilities seem to be
up-to-date with our learning.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to take breaks better when watching the lecture videos.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Maybe we could make the miro board more interactive during the seminars, like writing sticky notes besides code that
people have completed. This could be in the form of an actual exercise/activity, or it could be an ongoing thing that
is done regularly. This could help with our code review skills possibly?
In terms of my IT degree overall, I would like to be able to do the Games Design or 3D Modelling subjects in Cairns
(they are currently only available in Singapore) as they would be very interesting. I'm not sure if they are typically
relevant for IT specifically, but they would make for interesting electives in my opinion.
